# SafePass – A simple password manager!
## Introduction
This repository was submitted as the final project for CS50X 2023 online course offered by Harvard University. It’s a web application built around Flask’s framework and some software development/web programming languages covered by the course, such as Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS. The application is designed for storing passwords.

The central component of the application is the **password vault**, where the user can **store**, **retrieve**, **upload** and **delete** their credentials, which encompass domains, usernames, and passwords. To enable these interactions, the main application is **supported by additional files**, that contain **utilities** and **security** functions.

The project files follow the layout guidelines of Flask [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/tutorial/layout/], but in a simplified manner. The root files are app.py, helpers.py, security.py and schema.sql, serving as the backend of the application. Regarding the frontend, it is divided into two folders: static and templates. These folders host user-interactive functionality scripts, a style sheet and svgs, and HTML content, respectively.
