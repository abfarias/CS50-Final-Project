# SafePass – A simple password manager!
## Introduction
This repository was submitted as the final project for CS50X 2023 online course offered by Harvard University. It’s a web application for storing passwords, build around Flask’s framework and some software development/web programming languages covered by the course, such as Python, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS.

The main part of the application is the **password vault**, where the user can **store**, **retrieve**, **upload** and **delete** their passwords (where “passwords” is the combination of domain information, usernames, and actual passwords). To enable these interactions, the main application is **supported by additional files**, that contains **utilities** and **security** functions.
